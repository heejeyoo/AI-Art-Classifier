# AI-Art-Advisor
An AI-powered art classifier built with Streamlit. This app identifies the style of an uploaded painting using an SVM model and then leverages the Wikipedia and Gemini APIs to generate a unique, museum-guide style explanation. This project combines computer vision, external data APIs, and generative AI.
